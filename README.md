# Garage Door Opener
A simple solution to remotely control your garage door using a Raspberry Pi, a relay module, and a Flask web interfaceâ€”secured via SHA-256 password hashing. With ngrok, you can safely tunnel your local service to the internet and access it from anywhere. Support for garage status checking (open or closed) via magnetic reed switch coming soon!

## Service Daemons
Systemd service files are included for both the Flask app and ngrok, allowing them to start on boot without manual intervention. This ensures uninterrupted operation and makes the solution more robust.
